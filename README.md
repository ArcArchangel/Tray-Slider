# Tray-Slider

In this repository I have uploaded the codes used in the tray slider apk.

Grid Manager script is used to build the grid and spawn it and it also work to add snap point to those grids and record them and the changes made in the snap points in real time.

Tray Placer script is used to spawn the tray and place them on the grid at the start of the application.

Tray Snapper script is used to snap the tray to the nearest grid snap point to them so that after the move by sliding they will snap to the center of the grid.

Tray Swipe Mover script is used for the movement of the tray by swiping.
